# Test Format

Test item formats used in this examination are:

* Multiple-choice: Examinee selects one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.
* Multiple-response: Examinee selects more than one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.

All the questions asked in the exam are scenario-based. There are three parts to each question: A scenario, a question, and the options.

* A _**scenario**_ describes a situation with a use case or a client requirement on a Drupal site.
* Then a _**question**_ is asked about the scenario or the problem.
* Four or more _**options**_ are given for possible solutions from which the candidate needs to select the correct answer or answers. Take a look at the sample question:

**Scenario**  
You installed a new site using the Spanish language. You added new fields to the article content type alongside the default fields. The custom fields labels are in Spanish.

**Question**

Which of the following statements is true when you add the French language to your site?

**Answer Choices**

1. All content configuration should be translated to French manually
2. Drupal will handle both built in and custom field translations to French automatically
3. Drupal will handle translation of content configuration for built-in fields automatically. Custom fields will have to be translated manually
4. Drupal will handle translation of content configuration for custom fields automatically. Built-in fields will need to be translated manually

\(Correct answer: \#3\)

After looking at the sample question, you may realize that the questions rely on application of Drupal concepts and knowledge rather than purely memorizing the facts, code, or syntax.

Reading through long lists of documentation or books is not sufficient for answering most questions. You need experience with a number of use cases, applications, common scenarios in a Drupal project. It will also help to have experience with change requests, support requests and issues to handle questions of this nature
