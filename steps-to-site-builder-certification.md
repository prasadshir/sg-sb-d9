**Newcomer :** You are absolutely new to Drupal

**Learner** : You have Site Building experience with previous versions of Drupal, but new to Drupal 9

**Experienced** : You have Drupal 9 Site Building experience, wish to get certified.

## Take Acquia Academy Basic Level Courses

As a Newcomer to Drupal, take introductory courses in Acquia Academy. We have three courses to get you started on your Drupal journey.

● Introduction to Drupal

● Building a Basic Site Using Drupal

● Extending and Managing a Drupal Site

After taking the courses, build a small website on your own to reinforce the concepts learned in the courses.

## Take Acquia Academy 200 Level Courses

For the Site Builder path, the next step is to take a intermediate Level course in Acquia Academy.

* Building Websites with Drupal 

If you have previous experience in Drupal 7 Site Building, you should start here. The course covers advanced site building concepts and also contains hands-on exercises to help you build a Drupal 8 based website.

You can access Drupal preparatory courses on Acquia Academy, which you can find here:

[https://acquiacademy.com/](https://acquiacademy.com/)

You can access these courses for free and review them as many times as you like. Many of Acquia Academy courses are available, and if you are in an Acquia enablement or training program, you have been assigned the courses you most require to obtain an initial certification.

## Gain Practical Experience

Completing the courses may not make you ready for taking the certification exam. You need to have some real-life practical experience to attempt the exam. For this purpose, we recommend that you gain the practical experience by working on at least 2-3 real life projects.

## Perform Self Assessment

Once you decide to take up the exam, we recommend that you study the [domains and topics](exam-domains.md) covered by the exam and their relative weightings. You should also perform a [Self Assessment](self-assessment.md) of your own areas of strengths and weaknesses vis-a-vis the domains/topics covered by the exam blueprint. This is a recommended starting point for experienced Drupal 8 Site Builders.

## Use Labs and Study Guide

Based on your Self Assessment, you may need to gain knowledge and experience in some domains or topics. The best way to learn Drupal is by working or experimenting on it. Follow the suggestions given for preparation in the [Preparation section](preparation.md) and refer the external resources given in the [Study Guide](study-guide.md) section.
